## 🌟 Introduction

AutoBotNavigator is an advanced multi-agent path planning system designed for warehouse environments. It leverages reinforcement learning techniques to efficiently guide multiple autobots across complex grid layouts, ensuring collision-free navigation and optimal path planning.

### Why AutoBotNavigator?

- **Efficiency**: Optimizes paths for multiple autobots simultaneously.
- **Collision Avoidance**: Ensures safe navigation in shared spaces.
- **Scalability**: Adapts to various warehouse layouts and bot quantities.
- **Real-time Coordination**: Dynamically adjusts paths to avoid conflicts.
- **Simplicity**: Utilizes simple movement commands for easy integration.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The challenge is to guide multiple autobots across a matrix grid from their starting points (A) to their destinations (B), avoiding obstacles and each other. Key challenges include:

1. Collision Avoidance
2. Dynamic Movement
3. Matrix Layout Complexity
4. Real-Time Coordination

## 💡 Our Solution

AutoBotNavigator addresses these challenges through:

1. **Independent Q-Learning (IQL)**: Each autobot learns its optimal path independently.
2. **Prioritized Experience Replay**: Enhances learning from important experiences.
3. **Dueling Q-Network Architecture**: Improves value estimation for better decision-making.
4. **Dynamic Obstacle Handling**: Adapts to both static and moving obstacles.
5. **Parallel Action Execution**: Allows for simultaneous movement of multiple autobots.

## 🔑 Key Features

1. **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning**

   - Uses IQL for scalable multi-agent learning.
   - Each agent optimizes its path independently.

2. **Advanced Neural Network Architecture**

   - Implements Dueling Q-Network for better action-value estimation.
   - Separates state value and action advantage for more stable learning.

3. **Prioritized Experience Replay**

   - Focuses on important experiences to accelerate learning.
   - Adjusts sampling probability based on TD-error magnitude.

4. **Dynamic Environment Handling**

   - Adapts to changing obstacle positions.
   - Considers both static and moving obstacles in path planning.

5. **Collision Avoidance System**

   - Implements sophisticated logic to prevent inter-agent collisions.
   - Uses a combination of learned policies and rule-based safety checks.

6. **Flexible Grid Representation**

   - Supports various grid sizes and layouts.
   - Easily configurable for different warehouse setups.

7. **Performance Metrics**

   - Tracks total time and command count for optimization.
   - Provides insights into efficiency and areas for improvement.

8. **Visualization Tools**
   - Offers real-time visualization of agent movements.
   - Helps in understanding and debugging complex scenarios.

## 🔄 System Workflow

1. **Environment Initialization**:

   - Load the warehouse grid layout.
   - Initialize autobots at their starting positions.

2. **Training Phase**:

   - Agents explore the environment using ε-greedy policy.
   - Experiences are stored in prioritized replay buffer.
   - Neural networks are updated using sampled batches.

3. **Path Execution**:

   - Trained agents navigate from start to destination.
   - Real-time collision checking and avoidance.

4. **Performance Evaluation**:

   - Calculate total time and commands used.
   - Analyze efficiency and success rate.

5. **Iteration and Optimization**:
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters based on performance.
   - Retrain on more complex scenarios for robustness.
